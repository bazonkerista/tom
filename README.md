# The Other Monitor For StarCitizen

What was just something that I wanted to have on the other monitor while I play Star Citizen turned into this.

This is a dynamic Keyboard and Joystick Binding Viewer to reference on the other monitor or print.

It's a single html file, download tom.html and open it.

Some features
- Load custom mappings
- Load new versions of the game default bindings
- Set to light them for printing
- Change Colors
- Change the text of some items, by default they're sometimes too long
- Search through all (over 600) actions
- Edit button layouts, add joysticks, remove keyboard etc...
- F1-F8 Keys to quickly jump from one group of actions to another (also configurable)
- Save settings.

Here is the content of the help.
- l Quick Load custom mappings from the game
- f Actions with Search
- a ActionMap Groups
- c Load Page Config Settings
- F1 to F8 to select Game Mode on the top.
- F9 Save.
- F10 Menu or right click.
- CTRL+F1 help
- Double Click On A Key Actions List Filtered for that key

In the Actions List Search ( f )
- Double Click on the Action Text to change it
- Double Click on a custom input to change it.  If you have loaded a custom mappings file.

In the Configure Groups List ( a )
- Click on a UI group to grey out all but that group.
- Right click on a UI group to only show that group.

Saving Settings
- Input changes, keys, layouts, sizes etc...
- Action String changes
- UI group to game group changes
- Custom Mappings Last Loaded, Other Files last loaded.

Changes to Custom Mappings File

To make changes to inputs, in the Actions list, double click on the Custom Input box.
It only works if you have loaded a custom mapping file.

Sometimes you may see that there is a default mapping, and there is nothing in current.
This only means that there is an existing mapping to unset (blank). You need to remove the mapping to do something else with that.

Why
With over 600 actions in the game, I wanted something to refer to on the other monitor.

This is just for fun.  But if you'd like to donate, you can send bitcoin to 1GmNMaRpAP11cPtK6zzSYiEdaNxGC2prcL or send a thank-you note, or a dad joke that I can share with my kids to bazonkerista@gmail.com
